\section*{Question One}

A Group Graph is defined by four parameters m, k, p and q and is constructed as follows:\\
- Create mk vertices. The vertices are partitioned into m groups each of size k.\\
- For each pair of vertices that belong to the same group, add an edge between them with
probability p.\\
- For each pair of vertices that belong to different groups, add an edge between them
with probability q.\\
Investigate the degree distribution of Group Graphs for p + q = 0.5, p > q. Decide which
values of m, k, p and q to investigate. You should report on how the structure changes as p
and q vary and whether the same effects are found for different values of m and k. Use plots
to illustrate your observations. Investigate the relationship between the diameter of Group
Graphs and p (for fixed q).
